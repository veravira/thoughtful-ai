# Thoughtful AI - Customer Support Agent

## Objective
The Thoughtful AI Customer Support Agent is a conversational AI tool designed to assist users with basic questions about Thoughtful AI. It utilizes a predefined dataset of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers to provide instant responses. For questions outside the predefined dataset, the agent leverages a large language model (LLM) as a fallback.

---

## Features
- **Predefined Q&A Matching**: Hardcoded questions and answers about Thoughtful AI to ensure accurate responses for common queries.
- **Fallback to LLM**: For questions not covered in the dataset, the agent uses a Hugging Face-powered language model to generate responses.
- **User-Friendly CLI Interface**: A simple and interactive command-line interface for users to ask questions.

---

## Rules
The agent follows these guidelines:
1. Accepts user input and answers questions conversationally.
2. Retrieves the most relevant answer from the hardcoded dataset when possible.
3. Provides fallback responses using an LLM for unsupported queries.
